# Contributing — Local dev & checks

Welcome — this file contains the minimal steps for a single developer to run and validate the project locally.

## Quick commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run development server (fast, Turbopack):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run HTTPS development server (Safari macOS TLS issues):

```bash
npm run dev:https
```

Build for production (local check):

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the repository checks (lint + strict typecheck):

```bash
npm run check
```

- `npm run check` is an alias for running a strict lint (`npm run lint:ci`) followed by `tsc` type-checking. It is safe to run locally and is a canonical pre-merge gate used in CI.
- To auto-fix fixable lint issues for staged files, use `npm run lint:fix` or set up `lint-staged` (not configured by default).

## Security Scanning

This repo uses GitHub CodeQL for automated security scanning. CodeQL runs automatically on:

- Every push to `main` and `preview` branches
- Every pull request to `main`
- Daily at 06:00 UTC

You can also run dependency checks locally:

```sh
npm audit
```

## Pre-commit / pre-push hooks (recommended)

For a single-developer workflow, we do not enforce commit hooks by default. Consider adding `husky` + `lint-staged` to automatically format and lint staged files before commits.

Note: The repository runs a pre-commit scan for likely PII/Proprietary markers using `scripts/check-for-pii.mjs` (automatically via Husky pre-commit) and a PR-level scan via GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/pii-scan.yml`). This helps prevent accidental commits of sensitive content.

### Example files and private keys

If you include examples that show private key blocks or service account JSON, follow these rules:

- Use placeholders (e.g., `...`) and include `EXAMPLE` or `REDACTED` markers adjacent to the snippet.
- If a real key must be used for CI, store it securely in a secrets manager and never commit a real key into the repo.
- When in doubt, use subdirectory-specific private folders (e.g., `docs/security/private/`, `docs/operations/private/`) and external secure storage for sensitive examples.

## PII/Allowlist Handling

If you find that legitimate documentation (examples, placeholders, or definitions) is flagged by the PII/PI scanner, follow these steps to request an allowlist entry:

1. Open a non-breaking PR that updates `.pii-allowlist.json`.
2. Add the path (or domain/email) to `paths`/`proprietaryPaths` and add a `allowlistReasons` entry with a short justification and approver name.
3. In the PR description, provide a short explanation and why the path should be allowlisted (ex: `docs/ai/logging-security.md contains a definition; not real PI`).
4. At least one owner from the security/ops team (`@dcyfr`) must approve the change.

Note: Do not use allowlist entries as a shortcut to avoid redacting or removing real secrets. If a secret is found in the repo, remove it and add a remediation note to the PR instead.

If you maintain the allowlist or are preparing a change, use these helpers locally:

```bash
npm run validate:allowlist  # validate allowlist JSON has reasons for entries
npm run audit:allowlist     # print allowlist entries and reasons for audits
```

If you want to locally parse a gitleaks report (for debugging), run:

```bash
npm run parse:gitleaks-report ./gitleaks-report.json
```

### PII vs. PI Allowlisting Guidelines (Short Version)
- PII allowlist entries are for test data or placeholders (e.g., `example.com`, `test@test.com`) and should be treated conservatively; preference is to redact or mask. Add to `piiPaths` or `paths` as appropriate.
- PI allowlist entries (business or proprietary content) are for documentation that explains or defines proprietary systems (e.g., `docs/ai/logging-security.md`) and require stronger justification and an owner signoff; add to `piPaths` or `proprietaryPaths` as appropriate.

## Environment

If you rely on services (Redis, Resend, GitHub token) for local features, use `.env.local` or `vercel env pull .env.development.local` to populate environment variables. Example keys used by the app:

- `REDIS_URL` — Redis for view counts
- `RESEND_API_KEY` — emails via Resend
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — optional GitHub token for higher API rate limits

## Documentation Governance

All documentation is organized into **public** and **private** tiers to protect sensitive content.

### Public Documentation (`/docs`)

✅ **Share with world:** Architecture guides, API references, setup instructions, templates, design patterns
✅ **Audience:** Community, contributors, open source users
✅ **Examples:** `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/api/`, `/docs/templates/`

### Private Documentation (Subdirectory `private/` folders)

🔒 **Team only:** Security findings, audit reports, operational metrics, performance data, team decisions
🔒 **NOT committed to public git:** Excluded via `.gitignore`
🔒 **Audience:** Team members, authorized auditors
🔒 **Examples:** `/docs/security/private/`, `/docs/operations/private/`, `/docs/design/private/`

**Note:** Private documentation uses subdirectory-specific `private/` folders (e.g., `docs/security/private/`) instead of a centralized `docs/private/*` structure. This prevents duplicate content and keeps related materials together.

### Documentation Standards

**Before committing documentation:**

1. **Ask:** "Is this sensitive or internal?"
   - Security findings → `/docs/security/private/`
   - Operational metrics → `/docs/operations/private/`
   - Design decisions → `/docs/design/private/`
   - Public guidance → `/docs/`

2. **Name clearly:** Use prefixes for sensitivity
   - ✅ `FINDINGS_AND_ACTION_ITEMS.md` (obviously private)
   - ✅ `OPERATIONAL_STATUS_2025.md` (obviously private)
   - ❌ `status.md` (too vague)
   - ❌ `report.md` (unclear)

3. **Verify placement:** Pre-commit hook checks:
   ```bash
   git add docs/your-file.md
   git commit -m "docs: add documentation"
   # Hook runs automatically and blocks if file is in wrong place
   ```

4. **For detailed standards:** See [DOCS_GOVERNANCE.md](docs/DOCS_GOVERNANCE.md)

## How to contribute

- Make a small change in a branch.
- Run `npm run check` locally and fix errors/warnings.
- **For documentation:** Verify correct public/private placement (see Documentation Governance above).
- Open a pull request against the default branch and include a short description of the change.

### Proprietary Specifications

This project uses specialized AI agent instructions and pattern enforcement systems that are proprietary to dcyfr-labs.

#### What You CAN Do

✅ **Learn and reference** patterns from `/docs/ai/`  
✅ **Use templates** from `/docs/templates/` in your own projects  
✅ **Follow** documented design patterns and standards  
✅ **Request DCYFR mode** for your feature work  
✅ **Suggest improvements** via GitHub Issues  
✅ **Contribute** code that follows published patterns  

#### What You CANNOT Do

❌ **Redistribute** `.github/agents/` files or DCYFR specifications  
❌ **Use DCYFR architecture** in competing projects  
❌ **Modify** proprietary specifications without approval  
❌ **Copy** enforcement system to other repositories  
❌ **Claim ownership** of DCYFR system components  

#### How to Extend DCYFR

Want to improve DCYFR patterns or suggest new features?

1. **Open an issue** describing your suggestion
2. **Provide examples** of the pattern or problem
3. **Get approval** from @dcyfr before implementing
4. **Submit PR** linked to the approved issue
5. **Work collaboratively** on integration

This ensures proprietary systems remain secure while allowing collaborative evolution.
